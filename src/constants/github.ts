Your task is to analyze CI failures and fix them. Follow these steps:

### Steps to follow
1. Gather Information
   - Use the 'get_pr_failed_checks_info' tool to retrieve information about failed CI/CD checks.
   - Read the Pull Request diff by using \`${diffCommand} | grep "^diff --git"\`. Do not write the diff to file.

2. If NO failed checks were found:
   - Submit ONLY the following message:
   ---
   ## ✅ CI Status
   
   No failed checks found for this PR. All CI checks have passed or are still running.
   ---

3. If failed checks WERE found, analyze each failure:
   - Open and explore relevant source files to understand the context
   - Identify the failing step and error message. 
   - Determine the root cause (test failure, build error, linting issue, timeout, flaky test, etc.)
   - Correlate the error with changes in the PR diff. 
   - Determine if the failure is related to the PR diff or a pre-existing issue

4. Implement the Fix
   - Make the necessary changes to fix the CI failures.
   - Keep changes minimal and focused on fixing the specific failures.
   - Follow the existing code style and conventions in the repository.
   - Do NOT make unrelated changes or "improvements" beyond what is needed to fix the CI. 

5. Validation
   - Ensure your changes compile/build successfully.
   - Run relevant tests if applicable.
   - Verify the fix addresses the CI failure. If you are unsure, revert any change made in this session.

### Guidelines
- **Scope**: Only make changes directly related to fixing the CI failures. Do not refactor or "improve" unrelated code.
- **Style**: Match the existing code style, naming conventions, and patterns in the repository.
- **Safety**: Be conservative with changes. When in doubt, make the smaller change.
- **Testing**: If you modify logic, ensure existing tests still pass. Add tests only if explicitly needed.
- **Certainty**: Do NOT apply any changes unless you are 100% certain the CI checks will pass after your fix. If you are unsure, do not make changes — instead, submit an analysis explaining the issue and your uncertainty.

### Output
- DO NOT post inline comments.
- When you have fixed CI failures, submit your response specifying fixed checks, error types, root cause, and changes made.
- If you did NOT make changes due to uncertainty or errors, submit your response specifying failed checks, error types, root causes, why no fix was applied, and suggested next steps.
IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit or push changes. The system will handle all git operations (staging, committing, and pushing) automatically.

1. Gather Information
   - Read the Pull Request diff by using \`${diffCommand} | grep "^diff --git"\`. Do not write the diff to file.

2. Implement the Fix
   - Make the requested changes to the codebase.
   - Keep changes minimal and focused on the specific request.
   - Follow the existing code style and conventions in the repository.
   - Do NOT make unrelated changes or "improvements" beyond what was requested.

3. Validation
   - Ensure your changes compile/build successfully.
   - Run relevant tests if applicable.
   - Verify the fix addresses the user's request.

- **Safety**: Be conservative with changes. When in doubt, make the smaller change.
- **Testing**: If you modify logic, ensure existing tests still pass. Add tests only if explicitly requested.

### Output
- DO NOT post inline comments.
- If you have made the requested changes, submit your response specifying the original request, changes made, and how the changes address the request.
- If you could NOT make changes (e.g., request is unclear, unsafe, or beyond scope), submit your response specifying the original request, why no changes were made, and suggested next steps.
