Your task is to:
1. Read the Pull Request diff by using \`${diffCommand} | grep \"^diff --git\" \`. Do not write the diff to file.
2. Review the downloaded diff according to the criteria below
3. For each specific finding, use the 'post_inline_review_comment' tool (if available) to provide feedback directly on the code.
4. Once all findings are posted (or if the tool is unavailable), submit with your review as a bullet point list.

Additional instructions:
1. Review ONLY the changed lines against the Core Review Areas below, prioritizing repository style/guidelines adherence and avoiding overcomplication.
2. You may open files or search the project to understand context. Do NOT run tests, build, or make any modifications.
3. Do NOT create any new files. Do NOT commit or push any changes. This is a read-only code review and you don't have write access to the repository.

### Core Review Areas

1. **Adherence with this repository style and guidelines**
   - Naming, formatting, and package structure consistency with existing code and modules.
   - Reuse of existing utilities/patterns; avoiding introduction of new dependencies.

2. **Avoiding overcomplications**
   - Avoid new abstractions, frameworks, premature generalization, or unnecessarily complicated solutions.
   - Avoid touching of unrelated files.
   - Avoid unnecessary indirection (wrappers, flags, configuration) and ensure straightforward control flow.
   - Do not allow duplicate logic.

### If obviously applicable to the CHANGED lines only
- Security: newly introduced unsafe input handling, command execution, or data exposure.
- Performance: unnecessary allocations/loops/heavy work on UI thread introduced by the change.
- Error handling: swallowing exceptions or deviating from existing error-handling patterns.

### Output Format
- If the 'post_inline_review_comment' tool is available, use it for each specific finding.
- **Use the tool parameters correctly**:
    - \`filePath\`: The relative path to the file.
    - \`lineNumber\`: The line (or end of range) where the comment applies.
    - \`startLineNumber\`: Use this for multi-line comments to cover a range.
    - \`commentBody\`: Your explanation. Use the \`\`\`suggestion syntax here for code changes.
- Once all inline comments are posted, also submit your overall review as a bullet point list ONLY, with each comment following the format: - \`File.ts:Line: Comment\`. Do NOT include any summary, introduction, conclusion, notes, or any other text—ONLY the bullet points.
- Comment ONLY on the actual modifications in this diff. For lines that are modified (removed then re-added), comment only on what changed, not the unchanged parts of the line. Never comment on pre-existing code.
- Ensure that your suggestions are not already implemented, or equivalent to existing code.
- If you start to suggest a change and then realize it's already implemented or is not needed, skip the comment.
- Keep it concise (15–25 words per comment). No praise, questions, or speculation; omit low-impact nits.
- If unsure whether a comment applies, omit it. If no feedback is warranted, submit \`LGTM\` only .
- Only make comments of medium or high impact and only if you have high confidence in your findings.
- For small changes, max 3 comments; medium 6–8; large 8–12.

Your task is to analyze CI failures and fix them. Follow these steps:

### Steps to follow
1. Gather Information
   - Use the 'get_pr_failed_checks_info' tool to retrieve information about failed CI/CD checks.
   - Read the Pull Request diff by using \`${diffCommand} | grep "^diff --git"\`. Do not write the diff to file.

2. If NO failed checks were found:
   - Submit ONLY the following message:
   ---
   ## ✅ CI Status
   
   No failed checks found for this PR. All CI checks have passed or are still running.
   ---

3. If failed checks WERE found, analyze each failure:
   - Open and explore relevant source files to understand the context
   - Identify the failing step and error message. 
   - Determine the root cause (test failure, build error, linting issue, timeout, flaky test, etc.)
   - Correlate the error with changes in the PR diff. 
   - Determine if the failure is related to the PR diff or a pre-existing issue

4. Implement the Fix
   - Make the necessary changes to fix the CI failures.
   - Keep changes minimal and focused on fixing the specific failures.
   - Follow the existing code style and conventions in the repository.
   - Do NOT make unrelated changes or "improvements" beyond what is needed to fix the CI. 

5. Validation
   - Ensure your changes compile/build successfully.
   - Run relevant tests if applicable.
   - Verify the fix addresses the CI failure. If you are unsure, revert any change made in this session.

### Guidelines
- **Scope**: Only make changes directly related to fixing the CI failures. Do not refactor or "improve" unrelated code.
- **Style**: Match the existing code style, naming conventions, and patterns in the repository.
- **Safety**: Be conservative with changes. When in doubt, make the smaller change.
- **Testing**: If you modify logic, ensure existing tests still pass. Add tests only if explicitly needed.
- **Certainty**: Do NOT apply any changes unless you are 100% certain the CI checks will pass after your fix. If you are unsure, do not make changes — instead, submit an analysis explaining the issue and your uncertainty.

### Output
- DO NOT post inline comments.
- When you have fixed CI failures, submit your response using EXACTLY this format:
    ---
    ## ✅ CI Fix Applied
    
    **Fixed Check:** [name of the CI check that was failing]
    **Error Type:** [test failure / build error / lint error / timeout / other]
    
    ### Root Cause
    [1-3 sentences explaining why this failed]
    
    ### Changes Made
    - \`path/to/file.ts\`: [brief description of what was changed]
    - [additional files if applicable]
    
    ### Verification
    [Confirm that build passes and tests succeed, or describe what was verified]
    ---
- If you did NOT make changes due to uncertainty or errors, submit your response using this format instead:
    ---
    ## ⚠️ CI Analysis (No Changes Made)
    
    **Failed Check:** [name of the CI check that was failing]
    **Error Type:** [test failure / build error / lint error / timeout / other]
    
    ### Root Cause
    [1-3 sentences explaining why this failed]
    
    ### Why No Fix Was Applied
    [Explain your uncertainty and why you chose not to make changes]
    
    ### Suggested Investigation
    [What the developer should look into to resolve this]
